IMPLEMENTING SLURM IN A CONTAINERIZED HPC ENVIRONMENT WITH GPUs AND CPUs


Introduction 
The goal of this project is to outline the strategies for integrating Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management(SLURM) into our existing High-Performance Computing(HPC) platform. This platform currently utilizes containerized(Reservous) and will compose two clusters with GPUs and CPUs support. SLURM will allow us to manage and allocate resources more effectively and efficiently,providing better service to our users. 

Background
Our current HPC platform provides users with Rstudio access through containerized environments. The platformâ€™s infrastructure is managed using ansible ,with shared storage spaces. NFS is also employed for sharing data across the clusters. 

Objectives
Implement Slurm for efficient resource management and allocation within our HPC Platform
Maintain Rstudio functionality and accessibility for users 
Minimize disruptions to the current infrastructure and users workflows during the implementation process





 Proposed Slurm Integration 


SLURM installation and Configurations 
    Install and configure SLURM on the clusters 
    Use ansible to automate the installation and configuration process
    Define SLURM partition based on the available GPU and CU resources within the    cluster
Configure SLURM accounting and manage user resource usage 
2. Containerized SLURM integration 
       Integrate SLURM with our existing containerization system(Reservous) to launch and manage jobs
      Ensure Rstudio sessions can be launched as SLURM jobs within the containerized environment 
Modify the reservous configurations to enable the allocation of resources based on SLURM partitions and user requirements 
3. Nfs and Storage Integrations 
      Maintain NFS and shared storage configurations to ensure seamless access to data for users 
     Integrate SLURM with the existing storage setup to allocate storage resources based on user quotas and job requirements 
4. User access and Authentication
Configure SLURM to work with the existing user authentication system 
Ensure users can submit jobs  and access their data through Rstudio interface
Provide users with the necessary documentation and training to utilize the SLURM-based HPC-platform


DETAIL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
Phase 1: preparation 
    Assess the current infrastructure
Perform audit of the existing HPC infrastructure,including hardware and software and networking components 
Identify potential challenges such as hardware limitations,software incompatibilities or other obstacles that could affect the SLURM  integration
