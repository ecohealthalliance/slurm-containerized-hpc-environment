IMPLEMENTING SLURM IN A CONTAINERIZED HPC ENVIRONMENT WITH GPUs AND CPUs


Introduction 
The goal of this project is to outline the strategies for integrating Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management(SLURM) into our existing High-Performance Computing(HPC) platform. This platform currently utilizes containerized(Reservous) and will compose two clusters with GPUs and CPUs support. SLURM will allow us to manage and allocate resources more effectively and efficiently,providing better service to our users. 

Background
Our current HPC platform provides users with Rstudio access through containerized environments. The platformâ€™s infrastructure is managed using ansible ,with shared storage spaces. NFS is also employed for sharing data across the clusters. 

Objectives
Implement Slurm for efficient resource management and allocation within our HPC Platform
Maintain Rstudio functionality and accessibility for users 
Minimize disruptions to the current infrastructure and users workflows during the implementation process





 Proposed Slurm Integration 


SLURM installation and Configurations 
    Install and configure SLURM on the clusters 
    Use ansible to automate the installation and configuration process
    Define SLURM partition based on the available GPU and CU resources within the    cluster
Configure SLURM accounting and manage user resource usage 
2. Containerized SLURM integration 
       Integrate SLURM with our existing containerization system(Reservous) to launch and manage jobs
      Ensure Rstudio sessions can be launched as SLURM jobs within the containerized environment 
Modify the reservous configurations to enable the allocation of resources based on SLURM partitions and user requirements 
3. Nfs and Storage Integrations 
      Maintain NFS and shared storage configurations to ensure seamless access to data for users 
     Integrate SLURM with the existing storage setup to allocate storage resources based on user quotas and job requirements 
4. User access and Authentication
Configure SLURM to work with the existing user authentication system 
Ensure users can submit jobs  and access their data through Rstudio interface
Provide users with the necessary documentation and training to utilize the SLURM-based HPC-platform


DETAIL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
Phase 1: preparation 
    Assess the current infrastructure
Perform audit of the existing HPC infrastructure,including hardware and software and networking components 
Identify potential challenges such as hardware limitations,software incompatibilities or other obstacles that could affect the SLURM  integration 


The provided slurm.conf file contains the basic configuration for SLURM. However, there are a few adjustments and additions you may need to make based on your specific setup. Here's an overview of the configuration file:

ControlMachine: Specifies the hostname of the control machine (controller node). Change it to match the hostname of your controller node.

AuthType: Specifies the authentication type to be used. It is set to auth/munge, which is the recommended option for SLURM. No changes needed here unless you want to use a different authentication method.

StateSaveLocation: Specifies the directory where SLURM should store its state information. It should be on a shared file system accessible to all nodes in your cluster.

SlurmctldPidFile: Specifies the path to the PID file for the SLURM controller daemon.

SlurmctldPort and SlurmdPort: Specify the port numbers for the SLURM controller daemon and the SLURM compute daemons (workers), respectively.

ProctrackType: Specifies the process tracking method. It is set to proctrack/pgid, which is the recommended option for most setups.

SuspendProgram and ResumeProgram: Specify the paths to the scripts that handle job suspension and resumption.

SchedulerType: Specifies the scheduler type. It is set to sched/backfill, which is a common choice.

SelectType: Specifies the job selection plugin type. It is set to select/linear, which is a basic selection plugin.

MaxJobCount: Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous running jobs per user. Adjust it according to your requirements.

SlurmctldLogFile and SlurmdLogFile: Specify the paths to the log files for the SLURM controller and compute daemons, respectively.

JobAcctGatherFrequency and JobAcctGatherType: Specify the frequency and type of job accounting data collection.

NodeName: Defines the nodes in your cluster along with their respective attributes (e.g., number of CPUs, state). Adjust this section to match your worker node configurations.

PartitionName: Defines the partitions or queues available for job submission. The provided configuration defines a partition named "debug" with some basic settings. Adjust this section to match your desired partition configurations.

Make sure to review and update the configuration based on your specific cluster setup, such as the network configuration, file system paths, and resource specifications.
